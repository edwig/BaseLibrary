RELEASENOTES BASE LIBARY
========================

This base library has been created out of common classes from the Marlin, SQLComponents,
StyleFramework, bcd, StringIntegration and other projects on https://github.com/edwig
By doing so, the maintenancae of these libraries is strongly simplified.
Source project directories can be replaced in target projects bij simply replacing the
whole directory including the VS project files. 
Target projects are at least "Kwatta", "OpenODBCQuerytool", "Marlin", "CXHibernate".
But many more open source and commercial projects exist that use this base library.
