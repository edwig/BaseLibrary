RELEASENOTES BASE LIBARY
========================

This base library has been created out of common classes from the Marlin, SQLComponents,
StyleFramework, bcd, StringIntegration and other projects on https://github.com/edwig
By doing so, the maintenancae of these libraries is strongly simplified.
Source project directories can be replaced in target projects bij simply replacing the
whole directory including the VS project files. 
Target projects are at least "Kwatta", "OpenODBCQuerytool", "Marlin", "CXHibernate".
But many more open source and commercial projects exist that use this base library.

Version 2.0.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second main version of this library
This version was created when dropping the need for the use of the ATL/MFC libraries and 
mainly the use of the CString class.

Version 2.0.0 of 10-10-2025
---------------------------
1) The XString class is now soly derived from std::string and std::wstring.
   The macro redefinition of XString from CString has now been dropped.
2) Mainly **all** calls to methods that have a 'XString' parameter have been rewritten
   to 'const XString&' parameters.
   This removes the need for making many local copies of the string object, and thus
   mitigating the advantage that CString had with it's pointer like behaviour and
   copy-on-write design filosophy.
3) Place a call to "InitBaseLibrary()" in your application startup code.
   This initializes the settings for debugging memory leaks.
4) Added the "IsTextUnicodeUTF8" method to scan for UTF-8 texts in strings that have
   not been marked as such. E.g. by a UTF8 BOM (Byte-Order-Mark)
5) Corrections to various methods of XString


Version 2.0.1 of 16-11-2025
---------------------------
1) Updated to Visual Studio 2026.
2) Dropped the support for the 32-bit platform. The library is now only available
   for 64-bit platforms.
   The default test and support configuration is now the "UNICODE" build.
3) Fixed some minor issues with the SOAPMessage classa witht the overload of the
   AddParameter method, where the parameter "const LPTSTR" was changed to "LPCTSTR".
   Without this change the new compiler chooses the 'bool' paramter overload instead of
   the one with the string parameter.
4) Set/AddParameter methods of the SOAPMessage now infer the XmlDataType from their
   respective value parameters. Please change your code accordingly if you were using 
   these methods. The error did only occur in the Release build configurations.
5) The XmlDataType is now a true enum class. Also the parameters for the Set/Add methods
   of the SOAPMessage class have been changed to use "XmlDataType::Type" instead of
   just "XmlDataType". They are now placed AFTER the value parameter!!
   Please change your code accordingly.

Version 2.0.2 of xx-xx-2025
---------------------------
1) Added the RotatingTree class. This is a simple mapping index.
   It stores an index, but not whole objects.
   Outperforms STL std::map with a factor of 50%
