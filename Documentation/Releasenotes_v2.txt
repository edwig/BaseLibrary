RELEASENOTES BASE LIBARY
========================

This base library has been created out of common classes from the Marlin, SQLComponents,
StyleFramework, bcd, StringIntegration and other projects on https://github.com/edwig
By doing so, the maintenancae of these libraries is strongly simplified.
Source project directories can be replaced in target projects bij simply replacing the
whole directory including the VS project files. 
Target projects are at least "Kwatta", "OpenODBCQuerytool", "Marlin", "CXHibernate".
But many more open source and commercial projects exist that use this base library.

Version 2.0.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second main version of this library
This version was created when dropping the need for the use of the ATL/MFC libraries and 
mainly the use of the CString class.

Version 2.0.0 of 10-10-2025
---------------------------
1) The XString class is now soly derived from std::string and std::wstring.
   The macro redefinition of XString from CString has now been dropped.
2) Mainly **all** calls to methods that have a 'XString' parameter have been rewritten
   to 'const XString&' parameters.
   This removes the need for making many local copies of the string object, and thus
   mitigating the advantage that CString had with it's pointer like behaviour and
   copy-on-write design filosophy.
